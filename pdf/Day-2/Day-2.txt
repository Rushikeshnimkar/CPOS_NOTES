Q.  Why there is a need of an OS?
- Computer is a machine/hardware does different tasks efficiently & accurately.
- Basic functions of computer :
1. Data Storage 
: Memory Devices
2. Data Processing : CPU/Processor
3. Data Movement : I/O Devices
4. Control
- As any user cannot communicates/interacts directly with computer hardware to do different
tasks, and hence there is need of some interface between user and hardware.

Q.  What is an Operating System?
oAn OS is a system software (i.e. collection of system programs) which acts as an interface 
between  user and hardware.
oAn OS also acts as an interface between programs and hardware. 
oAn OS allocates resources like main memory, CPU time, i/o devices access etc... to all   
running programs, hence it is also called as a resource allocator.
oAn OS controls an execution of all programs and it also controls hardware devices which are 
connected to the computer system and hence it is also called as a control program.

oAn OS manages limited available resources among all running programs, hence it is also 
called as a resource manager. 
From End User: An OS is a software (i.e. collection of programs) comes either in CD/DVD, 
has following main components: 
1. Kernel: It is a core program/part of an OS which runs continuously into the main memory 
does basic minimal functionalities of it. e.g. Linux: vmlinuz, Windows: ntoskrnl.exe 
2. Utility Software's: e.g. disk manager, windows firewall, anti-virus software etc... 
3. Application Software's: e.g. Google chrome, shell, notepad, MS office etc...

programming language) given to the machine to do specific task. 
3 types of programs are there: 
1.
"user programs": programs defined by the programmer user/developers 
e.g. main.c, hello.java, addition.cpp etc.... 
2.
"application programs": programs which comes with an OS/can be installed later 
e.g. MS Office, Notepad, Compiler, IDE's, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Calculator, Games etc.... 
3.

What is an IDE (Integrated Software Development) ?
o It is an application software i.e. collection of tools/application programs like source code editor, pre-processor, 
compiler, linker, debugger etc... required for faster software development.
e.g. VS code editor, MS Visual Studio, Net beans, Android Studio, Turbo C etc.... 
1.
"Editor": it is an application program used to write a source code.
Source Code – Program written  in any programming language. 
e.g. notepad, vi editor, gedit etc... 
2.
"Pre-processor": it is an application program gets executes before compilation and does two jobs - it 
executes  all pre-processor directives and removes all comments from the source code. 
e.g. cpp 
3.
"Compiler": it is an application program which converts high level programming language code into low 
level programming language code i.e. human understandable language code into the machine
understandable   language code.

• Booting Concept :
• Booting is basically the process of starting the computer. 
• When the press Power Button  in first switched on it has nothing inside the Memory. 
• In order to start the Computer , Operating System (Secondary storage) loads into the Main Memory
(RAM) and then Computer is ready to take commands from the User.

Operating Systems Concepts
Dual Mode Operation:
System runs in two modes: 
1.
System Mode 
2.
User Mode 
1. System Mode: 
o When the CPU executes system defined code instructions, system runs in a system mode. 
o System mode is also referred as kernel mode/monitor mode/supervisor mode / privileged mode. 
2. User Mode: 
o When the CPU executes user defined code instructions, system runs in a user mode. 
o User mode is also referred as non - privileged mode. 
o Throughout execution, the CPU keeps switch between kernel mode and user mode 

--- Page 21 ---

Operating Systems Concepts
Dual Mode Operation: 
oThroughout an execution of any program, the CPU keeps switches in between 
kernel mode and user mode and hence system runs in two modes, it is referred 
as dual mode operation.
oTo differentiate between user mode and kernel mode one bit is there onto the 
CPU which is maintained by an OS, called as mode bit, by which the CPU 
identifies weather currently executing instruction is of either system defined 
code instruction/s or user defined code instruction/s. 
oIn Kernel mode value of mode bit = 0, whereas 
oIn User mode value of mode  bit = 1.

Process Management 
oWhen we say an OS does process management it means an OS is responsible for process 
creation, to provide environment for an execution of a process, resource allocation, 
scheduling, resources management, inter process communication, process coordination, 
and terminate the process. 
Q. What is a Program? 
User view: 
- Program is a finite set of instructions written in any programming language given to the 
machine to do specific task. 
System view: 
- Program is an executable file in HDD which divided logically into sections like exe header, 
bss section, data section, rodata section, code section, symbol table.

Q. What is a Process? 
User view: 
oProgram in execution is called as a process. 
oRunning program is called as a process. 
oWhen a program gets loaded into the main memory it is referred as a process. 
oRunning instance of a program is referred as a process. 
System view: 
oProcess is a program loaded into the main memory which has got PCB into the main memory 
inside kernel space and program itself into the main memory inside user space has got bss 
section, rodata section, code section, and two new sections gets added for the process .
- stack section: contains function activation records of called functions. 
- heap section: dynamically allocated memory

oAs a kernel, core program of an a OS runs continuously into the main memory, part of the 
main memory which is occupied by the kernel referred as kernel space and whichever part is 
left is referred as an user space, so main memory is divided logically into two parts: 
kernel space & user space.
o User programs gets loaded into the user space only. 
oWhen we execute a program or upon submission of a process very first one structure gets 
created into the main memory inside kernel space by an OS in which all the information 
which is required to control an execution of that process can be kept, this structure is 
referred as a PCB.
oPCB : Process Control Block, is also called as a Process Descriptor. 
oPer process one PCB gets created and PCB remains inside the main memory throughout an 
execution of a program, upon exit PCB gets destroyed from the main memory.

PCB mainly contains: 
• PID : Process ID
• PPID : Parent Processes ID
• PC  : Program Counter
• Execution context
• Kernel stack 
• Exit status
• CPU sched information, memory management information, information about resources 
allocated for that process, execution context etc...

1. Resident monitor
- Early (oldest) OS resides in memory and monitor execution of the programs. If it fails,
error is reported.
- OS provides hardware interfacing that can be reused by all the programs.
2. Batch System
- The batch/group of similar programs is loaded in the computer, from which OS loads one
program in the memory and execute it. The programs are executed one after another.
- In this case, if any process is performing IO, CPU will wait for that process and hence
not utilized efficiently.
3. Multi-programming
- Better utilization of CPU
- Loading multiple Programs in memory
- Mixed program(CPU bound + IO bound)

4. Time-sharing/Multitasking
- Sharing CPU time among multiple process/task present in main memory and ready for execution 
- Any process should have response time should be less then 1sec 
- Multi-tasking is divided into two types 
• Process based multitasking 
• Thread based multitasking 
- Thread is a light weight process .
- When new thread is created a new stack and new TCB is created. 
- Thread Share text, data, heap sections with the parent process
Process and thread 
-Process is a container for resources. 
-Thread is unit of execution/ scheduler. 
- For each process one thread is created by default it is called as main thread

5. Multi-user system 
- Multiple users runs multiple programs concurrently. 
6.
Multi-processor/ Mutli-core system
- System can run on a machine in which more than one CPU’s are connected in a closed circuit.
- Multiprocessing Advantage is it increased throughput (amount of work done in unit time) 
- There are two types of multiprocessor systems: 
Asymmetric Multi-processing 
- OS treats one of the processor as master processor and schedule task for it. The task is in turn divided into smaller tasks 
and get them done from other processors.
Symmetric Multi-processing 
- OS considers all processors at same level and schedule tasks on each processor individually. All modern desktop systems 
are SMP.

Operating Systems and Computer Fundamentals 
Process States: 
o To keep track on all running programs, an OS maintains few data structures referred as kernel data 
structures: 
1.
Job queue: it contains list of PCB’s of all submitted processes. 
2.
Ready queue: it contains list of PCB’s of processes which are in the main memory and waiting for 
the CPU time. 
3.
Waiting queue: it contains list of PCB’s of processes which are requesting for that particular device. 
I.
Job Scheduler/Long Term Scheduler: it is a system program which selects/schedules
jobs/processes from job queue to load them onto the ready queue. 
II.
CPU Scheduler/Short Term Scheduler: it is a system program which selects/schedules
job/process from ready queue to load it onto the CPU. 
Dispatcher: it is a system program which loads a process onto the CPU which is scheduled by the CPU 
scheduler, and the time required for the dispatcher to stops an execution of one process and to starts an 
execution of another process is referred as dispatcher latency.

Process States: 
oThroughout execution, process goes through different states out of which at a time it can be 
only in a one state. 
- States of the process: 
1. New state: upon submission or when a PCB for a process gets created into the main 
memory process is in a new state. 
2. Ready state: after submission, if process is in the main memory and waiting for the CPU 
time, it is in a ready state. 
3. Running state: if currently the CPU is executing any process then state of that process is 
considered as a running state. 
4. Waiting state: if a process is requesting for any i/o device then state of that process is 
considered as a waiting state. 
5. Terminated state: upon exit, process goes into terminated state and its PCB gets destroyed 
from the main memory.

Context Switch: 
- As during context-switch, the CPU gets switched from an execution context of one process 
onto an execution context of another process, and hence it is referred as "context-switch". 
- context-switch = state-save + state-restore 
- state-save of suspended process can be done i.e. an execution context of suspended process 
gets saved into its PCB. 
- state-restore of a process which is scheduled by the CPU scheduler can be done by the 
dispatcher, dispatcher copies an execution context of process scheduled by the cpu scheduler 
from its PCB and restore it onto the CPU registers. 
- When a high priority process arrived into the ready queue, low priority process gets suspended 
by means of sending an interrupt, and control of the CPU gets allocated to the high priority 
process, and its execution gets completed first, then low priority process can be resumed back, 
i.e. the CPU starts executing suspended process from the point at which it was suspended and 
onwards.

oCPU Scheduler gets called in the following four cases: 
Case-1: Running =>Terminated 
Case-2: Running => Waiting 
Case 3: Running => Ready 
Case-4: Waiting => Ready 
- There are two types of CPU scheduling: 
1. Non-preemptive: under non-preemptive cpu scheduling, process releases the control of 
the CPU by its own i.e. voluntarily. 
- e.g. in above case 1 & case 2 
2. Preemptive: under preemptive cpu scheduling, control of the CPU taken away  forcefully 
from the process. 
- e.g. in above case 3 & 4.

Following algorithms used for CPU Scheduling:
1. FCFS (First Come First Served) CPU Scheduling 
2. SJF (Shortest Job First) CPU Scheduling 
3. Round Robin CPU Scheduling 
4. Priority CPU Scheduling 
- Multiple algorithms are there for CPU scheduling, so there is need to decide which algorithm 
is best suited at specific situation and which algorithm is an efficient one, to decide this there are 
certain criteria's called as scheduling criteria's: cpu utilization, throughput, waiting time, 
response time and turn-around-time.

--- Page 36 ---
Sunbeam Infotech

Operating Systems and Computer Fundamentals 
CPU Scheduling Criteria's: 
1. CPU Utilization: one need to select such an algorithm in which utilization of the CPU must 
be as maximum as a possible. 
2. Throughput: total work done per unit time. One need to select such an algorithm in which 
throughput must be as maximum possible. 
3. Waiting Time: it is the total amount of time spent by the process into the ready queue for 
waiting to get control of the CPU from its time of submission. One need to select such an 
algorithm in which waiting time must be as minimum as possible. 
4. Response Time: it is a time required for the process to get first response from the CPU from 
its time of submission. One need to select such an algorithm in which response time must be 
as minimum as possible

5. Turn-Around -Time: it is the total amount of time required for the process to complete its
execution from its time of submission.
oOne need to select such an algorithm in which turn-around-time must be as minimum as 
possible.
oExecution Time: it is the total amount of time spent by the process onto the CPU to 
complete its execution. 
- OR CPU Burst Time: total no. of CPU cycles required for the process to complete its 
execution. 
oTurn-Around-Time = Waiting Time + Execution Time. 
oTurn-around-time is the sum of periods spent by the process into ready queue for 
waiting and onto the CPU for execution from its time of submission.

CPU Scheduling 
1. FCFS (First Come First Served ) CPU Scheduling 
- In this algorithm, process which is arrived first into the ready queue gets the control of the 
CPU first i.e. control of the CPU gets allocated for processes as per their order of an arrival 
into the ready queue. 
- This algorithm is simple to impalement and can be implemented by using fifo queue. 
- It is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm. 
Convoy effect: in fcfs, due to an arrival of longer process before shorter processes, shorter 
processes has to wait for longer duration and due to which average waiting time gets 
increases, which results into an increase in an average turn-around-time and hence overall 
system performance gets down.

2. SJF(Shortest Job First) CPU Scheduling: 
oIn this algorithm, process which is having minimum CPU burst time gets the control of the 
CPU first, and whenever tie is there it can be resolved by using fcfs. - SJF algorithm ensures 
minimum waiting time. 
oUnder non-preemptive SJF, algorithm fails if the submission time of processes are not same, 
and hence it can be implemented as preemptive as well. 
oNon-preemptive SJF is also called as SNTF(Shortest-Next-Time-First). 
oPreemptive SJF is also called as SRTF(Shortest-Remaining-Time-First). 
Starvation: in this algorithm, as shorter processes has got higher priority, process which is 
having larger CPU burst time may gets blocked i.e. control of the CPU will never gets 
allocated for it, such situation is called as starvation/indefinite blocking.

3. Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm 
o In this algorithm, before allocating the CPU for processes, some fixed time slice or time quantum 
gets decided in advanced, and at any given time control of the CPU may remains allocated with any 
process maximum for that decided time-slice, once the given time slice is finished of that process, it 
gets suspended and control of the CPU will be allocated to the next process again for maximum that 
decided time slice and so on..., each process gets control of the CPU in a round robin manner i.e. cpu 
gets shared among processes equally. 
o If any process completes its execution before allocated time slice then control of the CPU will be 
released by that process and CPU gets allocated to the next process as soon as it is completed for 
effective utilization of the CPU. 
o There is no starvation in RR Scheduling algorithm. 
o This algorithm is purely preemptive. 
o This algorithm ensures minimum response time. 
o If time slice is minimum then there will be extra overhead onto the CPU due to frequent context-
switch.

4. Priority Scheduling 
o In this algorithm, process which is having highest priority gets control of the CPU first, each process is 
having priority in its PCB. 
o priority for a process can be decided by two ways: 
1. internally – priority for process can be decided by an OS depends on no. of resources 
required for it. 
2. externally – priority for process can be decided by the user depends on requirement. 
o Minimum priority value indicates highest priority. 
o This algorithm is purely preemptive. 
o Due to the very low priority process may gets blocked into the ready queue and control of the CPU 
will never gets allocated for such a process, this situation is referred as a starvation or indefinite 
blocking. 
o Ageing: it is a technique in which, an OS gradually increments priority of blocked process, i.e. priority 
of blocked process gets incremented after some fixed time interval by an OS, so that priority of blocked 
process becomes sufficient enough to get control of the CPU, and starvation can be avoided.

Multi-level queue :
•
In modern OS, the ready queue can be divided into multiple sub-queues and processes are arranged in them 
depending on their scheduling requirements. This structure is called as "Multi-level queue". 
• If a process is starving in some sub-queue due to scheduling algorithm, it may be shifted into another sub-queue. 
This modification is referred as "Multi-level feedback queue". 
• The division of processes into sub - queues may differ from OS to OS.
