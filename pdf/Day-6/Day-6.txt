File Management 
Q. What is file? 
User view: 
oFile is a container which contains logically related information/data.
oFile is a collection of characters/records/lines. 
oFile is a basic storage unit 
System view:
o File is a stream of bits/bytes. 
oFile = data + metadata 
data = actual file contents 
metadata = information about the file.

Operating Systems Concepts
• Data of the file is exists inside the file whereas information about the file gets 
stored inside one structure referred as FCB (File Control Block).
• In UNIX environment FCB is also called as an iNode.
• FCB / iNode contains information about the file like:
1. iNode number: unique identifier of a file 
2. Name of the file 
3. Type of the file 
4. Size of the file 
5. Parent folder location 
6. Access permissions 
7. Time stamps etc...

Operating Systems Concepts
oPer file one iNode/FCB gets created by the system and 
-i.e. hence no. of iNodes = no. of files onto the disk.
o data + metadata of all the files are kept onto the disk, as disk may 
contents thousands of files, so thousands of iNodes and millions of 
bytes of data gets stored onto the disk, and hence all this data + 
metadata of all files need be keep onto the disk in an organized 
manner so that it can be accessed efficiently.

oFile system :  file system is a way to store data onto the disk in an 
organized manner so that it can be accessed efficiently and 
conveniently. 
• e.g. Each OS has its own file system like, 
• UNIX: UFS(UNIX File system), 
• Linux: Extended File system ext2, ext3, ext4, 
• Windows: FAT, NTFS etc..., 
• MAC OSX: HFS(Hierarchical File system) etc...

Disk space allocation methods: 
- When a file is requesting for free data blocks, then in which manner free data blocks 
gets allocated for that file and how its information can be kept inside inode of that file 
is referred as disk space allocation method. 
Three disk space allocation methods are there: 
1. Contiguous Allocation
2. Linked Allocation
3. Indexed Allocation

Operating Systems Concepts
1. Contiguous Allocation : free data blocks gets allocated for a file in a contiguous manner. 
Advantages :
1. Sequential access.
2. Random access .
3. Simple to implement.
Disadvantages :
1. File may not grow(Limitations).
2. External fragmentation
-Number of blocks required are available   
but not contiguous.
Defragmentation :
-Moves files on disk so that maximum 
contiguous free space is available.

2. Linked Allocation: any free data blocks gets allocated for a file in a linked list manner.
Advantages :
1. Sequential access.
2. No file grow limit. 
3. No external fragmentation.
Disadvantages :
1. Slow random access.
Example : FAT

index data block information about allocated data blocks can be kept inside it.
Advantages :
1. Sequential Access.
2. Random Access.
3. No External Fragmentation
Disadvantages :
1. File cant grow up to some limit.
Example : UFS , EXT 2 , EXT 3

Disk Scheduling Algorithms: 
oWhen system want to access data from a disk, request can sent to disk controller 
and disk controller accepts one request at a time and complete it. 
oThere are chances that at a time more than one requests for accessing data from 
the disk can be made by the processes running in a system, in that case all the 
requests can be kept in a waiting queue of the disk maintained by an OS, and 
there is need to schedule/select only one request at a time and sent it to the 
disk controller, to do this there are certain algorithms referred as disk 
scheduling algorithms.

--- Page 12 ---
Sunbeam Infotech

Operating Systems Concepts
1. FCFS (First Come First Served): request which is arrived first gets 
accepted and completed. 
2. SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First): request which is closed to the current 
position of the head gets accepted and completed. 
3. SCAN: head keeps scanning the disk from starting cylinder to end 
cylinder and whichever request came across gets accepted and completed. 
4. C-SCAN (Circular SCAN): head scans the disk only in a one direction.
5. LOOK: this policy can be used either with SCAN/C-SCAN, in this, if 
there is no request in a waiting queue then movement of the head gets 
stopped.

Magnetic Disk : Hard Disk Drive Structure 
o HDD is made up of one or more circular platters arranged like CD rack. 
o A Circular platter is a made up of non-magnetic substance like aluminum or aluminum alloy, which 
is coated with a magnetic substance. 
o Coating of magnetic substance is either from one side to the platter or from both the sides (for 
increasing its capacity) and hence platter in a magnetic disk may be either single sided platter or double 
sided platter.
o Circular platter is divided into the hundred’s of concentric rings called as tracks whereas each 
track is divided into thousands of same size of blocks called as sectors. 
o Usually the size of each sector is 512 bytes
o There is one conducting coil referred as head which is used to access data from the sector i.e. head 
can read and write data from and into a sector at a time. 
o Head writes and read data sector by sector i.e. block by block, and magnetic disk is also called as 
block device.

Computer Fundamentals and Operating Systems
• All the operations like read, write, control etc... in a HDD are controlled by disk controller, 
and hence movement of the head also controlled by it. 
• Seek Time: time required for the disk controller to move head from its current position to the 
desired track. 
• Rotational Latency: after reaching head at desired track, circular platter gets rotated till the 
head does not comes aligned with the desired sector, and time required for this rotation is 
referred as rotational latency. 
• Access Time = Seek Time + Rotational Latency.

USER INTERFACE 
1. CUI/CLI : Command User Interface/Command Line Interface 
- By using this kind of interface user can interacts with an OS by means entering commands onto the 
terminal/command line in a text format. 
- e.g. In Windows name of the program which provide CUI => cmd.exe 
- command prompt In Linux name of an application program which provides CUI => shell/terminal 
- In MSDOS name of the program which provides CUI => command.com (Microsoft Disk Operating System). 
2. GUI : Graphical User Interface 
- by using this kind of interface user can interacts with an OS by means making an events like click on buttons, left 
click/right click/double click, menu bar, menu list etc..... 
- Windows = User friendly GUI.
- e.g. In Windows name of an application program which provides GUI => explorer.exe
- In Linux name of an application program which provides GUI => GNOME/KDE (GNU Network Object Model 
Environment / Common Desktop Environment).

Security and Protection
• Security:
• Securing the Computer from external threats(Threats possibly malicious program) like virus,worms, 
Trojans, malware and hacking.
• Usually security is not the part of many OS. However, nowadays Windows OS provide security with 
Windows Defender.
• Mostly security handle by Antivirus program and Firewall. 
• Protection:
• Protecting the system component from internal threats / Programs.
• Files of one user are not accessible to other user.
• Dual Mode protection i.e. CPU modes –User Mode/ System Mode.
• Memory of one process protected from another process.
Networking
• Now Days Networking is supported by all OS.
• Internally OS does transfer data to other computer using Socket IPC.

IO Modules/IO Controller: 
oCore Computer system is not able to communicates directly with any external device and 
hence I/O modules acts as an interface between core computer system and an I/O devices.
oEach IO device has its own internal dedicated processing unit called  ‘as IO module’.
oI/O Modules contains all the logic to communicates with an I/O devices. 
oSingle I/O module can be used for communication between one device or with more than one 
devices as well.
Device Driver - is a program within operating system that send/receive data/command
to/from IO device controller and also handles interrupts send From the device

Structure of an External Device
o External Device has three major blocks: 
1. Control Logic Block(Controller): controls all the operations of that device. 
2. Buffer: each device has its own memory in which data can be stored temporarily referred as 
a buffer. 
3. Transducer: this component converts any other form of energy into an electrical enery and 
converts an electrical energy into another form, this block of an external device is used to do 
communication with the outside world.
IO Steps
1.
CPU checks I/0 module device status
2.
I/0 module returns status
3.
If ready, CPU requests data transfer
4.
I/0 module gets data from device
5.
I/0 module transfers data to CPU.

Whenever there is transfer of data either from core computer system 
(i.e. Bus) to an IO devices or vice-versa, it is referred as an I/O.
There are three IO techniques: 
1. Program driven IO 
2. Interrupt IO 
3. DMA i.e. Direct Memory Access

--- Page 32 ---
Sunbeam Infotech

Computer Fundamentals and Operating Systems
1. Program driven IO:
oAll the logic/steps required for an I/O is there into one program, and by means of 
executing that program by the CPU I/O  can be done.
oCPU waits for IO operations to be completed. This is also called "Polling".
oWhen OS/program waits for the IO to be completed, it is called as "Synchronous IO".
Advantages: 
o Simple 
Disadvantages: 
o As the CPU remains wholly involved in an IO, less CPU utilization, and hence system performance is 
low.

Computer Fundamentals and Operating Systems
2. Interrupt IO: 
What is an interrupt?
o An interrupt is a signal received by the CPU due to which it stops an execution of one job and starts an execution 
of another job. 
o CPU issues a command, and proceed for its work until interrupt by IO device
o Since OS does not wait for the IO completion, it is called as "Asynchrous IO".
Advantages: 
o In this IO, the CPU remains involved in an IO whenever gets interrupted, and hence its cpu utilization can be 
maximized. 
Disadvantages: 
o When there is a data transfer between main memory & secondary memory unnecessary involvement of the CPU 
is there.

Interrupt Handling :
• Interrupt handling function is also called as interrupt service rutine(ISR).
• There are many IO devices in system , so there interrupt handling process also different 
like keyboard , mouse , disk etc..
• So there are Table maintain by OS that store all device interrupt function starting 
address . This table is called as Interrupt Vector Table(IVT).
Interrupt Types
• Hardware Interrupt : 
• Interrupt received from hardware
• E.g. mouse , keyboard , storage devices … etc. 
• Software Interrupt
• Interrupt received from Software
• E.g. system call, antivirus ..

3. DMA (Direct Memory Access):
oWhenever there is a transfer of data between core computer system and IO devices (e.g. main 
memory and secondary memory), the CPU initiates an IO and gives control of an IO process 
to the DMA controller, and hence onwards that IO process is controlled by the DMC 
controller till the end i.e. the DMA controller will work on behalf of the CPU and after 
finishing an IO it sends acknowledgement to the CPU, and by the time the CPU can execute 
another jobs, and utilization of the CPU can be maximized further.
o e.g. 8237 DMA controller
