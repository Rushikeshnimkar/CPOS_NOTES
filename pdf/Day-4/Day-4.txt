Memory holds (digital) data or information. 
-Bit = Binary Digit (0 or 1) => Internally it is an electronic circuit i.e. FlipFlop
-1 Byte = 8 Bits 
-B, KB (2^10), MB (2^20), GB (2^30), TB (2^40), PB (2^50), XB (2^60), ZB (2^70)
Memory Technologies
There are four methods by which data can be accessed from the computer memory: 
1.
Sequential Access: e.g. Magnetic Tape 
2.
Direct Access: e.g. Magnetic Disk
3.
Random Access: e.g. RAM Memory 
4.
Associative Access: e.g. Cache Memory

Memory Access 
• CPU <----> Memory 
• Bus
• set of wire to use connection / data transfer.
• Address bus 
• Unidirectional from CPU to the memory 
• Address represent location of the memory to read/write 
• Number of lines = number of locations 
• Data bus 
• Bi-directional from/to CPU to/from the memory 
• Carries the data
• Number of lines = width of data unit 
• Control bus 
• Read/Write operation 
• CPU <---> Cache <---> RAM <---> Disk

Computer memory can be categorized into two categories as per  its location:
Internal Memory & External Memory. 
Internal Memory: memory which is internal to the motherboard is referred as an 
internal memory. 
• e.g. CPU registers, L1 & L2 cache Cache memory, RAM.
External Memory: memory which is external to the motherboard is referred as an 
external memory.
• e.g. Magnetic disk, Optical disk, magnetic tape , Pen Drive etc...
Volatile vs Non-volatile memory 
- Volatile memory: The contents of memory are lost when power is OFF. 
- Non-volatile memory: The contents of memory are retained even after power is OFF.

Computer memory can also categorized into two categories: Primary Memory 
& Secondary  Memory.
1. Primary Memory: memory which can be accessible directly by the CPU is referred as 
primary memory, i.e. memory which can accessible by the CPU with the help of instruction 
set having with the CPU. 
• e.g. CPU registers, L1 & L2 Cache, Cache Memory, RAM
2. Secondary Memory: memory which cannot be accessed directly by the CPU is referred as 
secondary memory.
• e.g. Magnetic Disk, CD/DVD, PD etc.. 
• If the CPU want to access disk contents, first it gets fetched into the RAM and then it can be     accessed by the 
CPU from RAM.
o As for an execution of every program RAM memory is must and hence RAM is also called as 
Main memory.

Computer Memory Technologies: 
oCPU Registers: 
o memory which is very close to the CPU are registers which is at the top in a computer memory 
hierarchy.
o Instructions and data currently executing by the CPU can be kept temporarily into the CPU 
registers.
Why there is a need of cache memory? 
o As the rate at which the CPU can execute instructions is faster than the rate at which data can be 
accessed from the main memory, so even the CPU is very fast, with the same speed data do not gets 
fetched from the main memory for execution, hence due to this speed mismatch overall system 
performance gets down. 
o To reduce speed match between the CPU and the main memory Cache memory (hardware) can be 
added between them and system performance can be increases by means reducing speed 
mismatch.

What is Cache Memory ?
o Cache memory is faster memory, which is a type RAM i.e. SRAM, in which most recently 
accessed main memory contents can be kept/stored in an associative manner i.e. in a key-
value pairs. 
oThere are two types of RAM: 
1. DRAM (Dynamic RAM): memory cells are made up of capacitors and transistor.
- Main memory is as example of DRAM. 
2. SRAM (Static RAM): memory cells are made up of transistor.
- Cache Memory is an example of SRAM

oCache Memory has C no. of lines, whereas each line is divided into two parts, each line 
contains k words of data (recently accessed main memory contents ) and its main memory 
addresses can be kept in few tag bits. 
1. First part of a line : few tag bits contains main memory addresses of k words of data in 
that line 
2. Second part : of a line contains k words of data. 
oWhen the CPU want to fetch data from the main memory it requests for its address, and this 
requested address gets searched into the cache memory first, if requested addr is found in the 
cache memory then data also found in a cache memory, it is referred as cache hit, whereas if 
the requested address and hence data is not found in a cache memory then it is referred as a 
cache miss, in that data gets fetched from main memory and gets transferred to the CPU via 
cache memory only.

Computer Fundamentals and Operating Systems
oEven after adding cache memory between the CPU and main memory, the rate at which the 
CPU can execute instructions is faster than the rate at which at which data can be accessed 
from cache memory, and hence to reduce speed mismatch between the CPU and cache 
memory one or more levels of cache memory i.e. L1 cache & L2 cache can be added between 
them. 
oDisk Cache: it is purely a software technique in which portion of the main memory can be 
used as a cache memory in which most recently accessed disk contents can be kept in an 
associative manner, so whenever the CPU want to access data from hard disk drive it first gets 
searched into the disk cache. 
oDisk cache technique is used to reduce speed mismatch between the CPU and Secondary 
memory

ROM (Read Only Memory)
• Read-only memory (Not writable).
• This type of memory is non-volatile.
• The information is stored permanently.
• Programs (executable instructions) stored in ROM are called -- Firmware. e.g. BIOS, Bootstrap loader, POST, ... 
• Types of ROM
• Masked ROM (MROM) -- contents are fixed while manufacturing
• Programmable ROM (PROM) -- one time writable
• Erasable Programmable ROM (EPROM) -- written multiple times with special circuit
• Ultra-Violet EPROM (UV-EPROM) -- all contents erased using UV rays
• Electrical EPROM (E-EPROM) -- erase selected bytes using high electric current
• Flash (like E-EPROM) -- erase selected blocks - high speed

Virtual memory / Swap area
Swap area: it is a portion of the hard disk drive ( keep reserved while installation of an OS) 
can be used by an OS as an extension of the main memory in which inactive running 
programs can be kept temporarily and as per request processes can be swapped in and 
swapped out between swap area and the main memory by system program named as memory 
manager.
o In Linux swap area can be maintained in the form of swap partition, whereas in Windows swap 
area can be maintained in the form of swap files. 
oConventionally size of the swap area should be doubles the size of the main 
memory, i.e. if the size of main memory is 2 GB then size of swap area should be 4 GB, if the 
size of main memory is 4 GB then size of swap area should be 8 GB and so on. 
oVirtual memory advantages:
o Can execute more number of programs. 
o Can execute bigger sized programs.

Swapping:
oSwapping done by the system program of an OS named as Memory Manager, 
it swap ins active running programs into the main memory from swap area and 
swap outs inactive running programs from the main memory and keep them 
temporarily into the swap area. 
oThere are two variants of swapping: swap in & swap out.

Memory Management
. Why there is a need of memory (main memory )management ? 
oAs main memory is must for an execution of any program and it is a limited memory, hence 
an OS manages main memory. 
oTo achieve maximum CPU utilization, an OS must support multitasking, and to support 
multi-tasking multiple processes must be submitted into the system at a time i.e. it must 
support multiprogramming, but as main memory is limited to support multiprogramming an 
OS has to do memory management to complete an execution of all submitted processes.
o Memory space of one process should gets protected from another process.

Operating Systems Concepts
oAddresses generated by compiler (i.e. compiler + linker) are referred as 
logical addresses.
o Addresses which can be see by the process when it is in the main memory 
referred as physical addresses.
o MMU (Memory Management Unit): which is a hardware unit converts logical 
address into physical address. 
oMMU is a hardware contains adder circuit, comparator circuit, base register and 
limit register. Values of base register and limit registers gets change during 
context-switch, and memory space of one process gets protected from another 
process. 
oCPU always executes program in its logical memory space.

Memory Allocation: 
oWhen a process is requesting for the main memory, there are two methods by 
which memory gets allocated for any process. 
1.
Contiguous Memory Allocation 
i.
Fixed Size Partitioning 
ii.
Variable Size Partitioning
2.
Non - contiguous Memory Allocation
i.
Segmentation
ii.
Paging

1. Contiguous Memory Allocation:
oUnder this method, process can complete its execution only if memory gets 
allocated for it in a contiguous manner. 
oThere are two methods by which memory gets allocated for process under 
contiguous memory allocation method. 
1. Fixed Size Partitioning 
2. Variable Size Partitioning

Operating Systems Concepts
1. Fixed Size Partitioning: 
oIn this method, physical memory i.e. main memory (user space) is divided into fixed number 
of partitions and size of each partition is remains fixed.
o If any process is requesting for the memory it can be loaded into main memory in any free 
partition in which it can be fit.
Advantages: 
oThis method is simple to implement.

--- Page 21 ---

Operating Systems Concepts
Disadvantages: 
oInternal fragmentation: if memory remains unused which is internal to the partition.
oDegree of multi-programming is limited to the number of partitions in the main memory. 
oMaximum size of a process is limited to max size partition in the main memory.
o To overcome limitations/disadvantages of fixed size partitioning method, variable/dynamic 
size partitioning method has been designed.

2. Variable/Dynamic Size Partitioning: 
• In this method, initially whole user space i.e. physical memory is considered as a single free 
partition, and processes gets loaded into the main memory as they request for it. 
• Size of partition and number of partitions are not fixed in advanced, it gets decided dynamically.
• After allocation and de-allocation of few processes, RAM will have few used slots and few free 
slots. 
• OS keep track of free slots in form of a table. For any new process, OS use one of the following 
mechanism to allocate the free slot. 
• First Fit: Allocate first free slot which can accommodate the process. 
• Best Fit: Allocate that free slot to the process in which minimum free space will remain. 
• Worst Fit: Allocate that free slot to the process in which maximum free space will remain. 
• Statistically it is proven that First fit is faster algorithm , while best fit provides better 
memory utilization.

Advantages: 
• There are very less chances of internal fragmentation 
• Degree of multi-programming is not limited/fixed 
• Size of the process is not also limited, any size process may get load into the main memory. 
Disadvantages: 
• External fragmentation: due to loading and removing of processes into and from the main 
memory, main memory is fragmented 
- i.e. gets divided into used partitions and free partitions.
• In such case, if any new process is requesting for the memory and even if the requested size of 
memory is available, but due to unavailability of the memory in a contiguous manner request of that 
process cannot be accepted, this problem is referred as an external fragmentation.
• External fragmentation is the biggest problem under contiguous memory allocation, and hence the 
solutions on this problem: 
1. Compaction 

--- Page 24 ---

Operating Systems Concepts
Compaction: 
oshuffling of main memory can be done in such a way that all used partitions 
can be shifted to one side and all free partitions can be shifted to other side 
and contiguous large free partition will be made available for the new 
processes. 
oCompaction is practically not feasible as there is need to do recalculations 
of addresses every time.

2. Non- contiguous Memory Allocation:
oUnder this method, process can complete its execution even if memory gets 
allocated for it in a non - contiguous manner, and it can be achieved by two 
memory management techniques: 
1. Segmentation 
2. Paging 
oSo by using segmentation & paging techniques, process can complete its 
execution even after memory gets   allocated for it in a non- contiguous 
manner. 

--- Page 26 ---
Sunbeam Infotech

Operating Systems Concepts
1. Segmentation
o In this technique, process in its logical memory is divided into small size 
segments like stack segment, heap segment, data segment, bss segment , 
rodata segment, code segment etc..., and when process is requesting for 
memory it is not requesting memory contiguously for whole process, memory 
gets allocated contiguously only for small size segments, and segments of one 
process may get load into the memory randomly at any locations, 
oi.e. for a process memory gets allocated in a non - contiguous manner, and 
then only an execution of a process can be completed.

--- Page 27 ---
Sunbeam Infotech

Computer Fundamentals and Operating Systems
oAs segments of a one process gets loaded randomly into the main memory, and 
in a system thousands processes are running at a time, hence to keep track on all 
the segments of each process, an OS maintains one table per process referred as 
a segmentation table in which information about all the segments of that 
process can be kept.
o Using segmentation an external fragmentation can be reduced but cannot be 
completely avoided => to overcome this limitation paging technique has 
been designed.

2. Paging : 
o In this technique, physical memory (i.e. user space of a main memory) is divided into fixed size of 
blocks referred as frames, and process’s logical memory space is divided into same size of blocks 
referred as pages, whereas maximum size of page must be equal to size of frame, i.e.
o if e.g. size of frame = 4K, then maximum size of each page must be 4K, size of page may be less 
than 4K. 
o As process is divided into pages, so when it is requesting for memory, pages of one process may gets 
loaded into the main memory at any free frames, and for a process memory gets allocated in a non -
contiguous manner.
o As pages of a one process gets loaded randomly into the main memory, and in a system thousands 
processes are running at a time, so to keep track on all the pages of each process, an OS maintains one 
table per process referred as a page table in which information about all the pages of that process can be 
kept. 
o There is no external fragmentation in paging. 
o Internal fragmentation may exists in paging when the size of page is less than size of frame.

Virtual Memory Management:
o As we seen an OS does memory management for completing an execution of multiple submitted processes 
at once. 
o An OS also able to complete an execution of such a process having size bigger than size of main memory 
itself, and to achieve this an OS manages swap area memory as well with main memory and hence it is 
referred as virtual memory management. 
o As an OS manages such a memory which is physically not a main memory and hence it is referred as 
virtual memory management. 
o Virtual memory management can be implemented by using Paging + Swapping. 
o In this technique for a process to complete its execution it is not mandatory it must exists wholly in a main 
memory, even its part is their into the main memory then execution of such process can be completed part 
by part. 
o Big size process is divided into pages and when a process is requesting for memory few pages gets loaded 
into the main memory and few pages can be kept into the swap area, and as per the request pages of that 
process can swapped in and swapped out between main memory and swap area.

o Demand Paging: any page of a process gets loaded into the main memory only after 
requesting by that process i.e. on demand and hence referred as demand paging.
o The page which is never requested never gets loaded into the main memory and hence it also 
called as pure demand paging. 
o If a process is requesting for any page and if that page is not exists in the main memory, then it 
is referred as page fault.
oAs the size of process may be bigger than size of main memory itself, and in a system multiple 
processes are running at a time, hence no. of pages are more than no. of frames, so there are 
quite good chances that all frames becomes full, and in this case if any process is requesting for 
a page which does not exists in the main memory at that time there is need to remove any one 
page from the main memory so that into that free frame requested page will get loaded. 
o So there is need to decide which page should get removed and requested page gets replaced in 
that frame, to do this there are certain algorithms referred as page replacement algorithms.

Page Replacement Algorithms: 
1. FIFO Page Replacement: page which was inserted first gets replaced by the 
requested page. 
2. Optimal Page Replacement: page which will not get used in a near future gets 
replaced by the requested page 
3. LRU(Least Recently Used) Page Replacement: least recently used page gets 
replaced by the requested page. 
4. LFU(Least Frequently Used) Page Replacement: least frequently used page gets 
replaced by the requested page. 
5. MFU(Most Frequently Used) Page Replacement: most frequently used page gets 
replaced by the requested page.

Operating Systems Concepts
• Algorithms 1, 2 & 3 uses stack based approach, whereas algorithms 4 & 5 uses counting 
based approach. 
• Conceptually Optimal Page Replacement is the most efficient page replacement algorithm, as 
no. of page faults in this algorithm are very less, but as its practical implementation is not 
feasible hence LRU is the most efficient algorithm (implementation wise)
Thrashing: 
oIf any process spends more time on paging rather than execution, then this high paging 
activity is referred as thrashing.
oSolution: Increase RAM size.
